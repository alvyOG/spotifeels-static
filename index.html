        <h1>Big Questions</h1>
        <ol class=.ol-custom>
            <li class=.li-custom-q>Q: Can we develop a search engine that allows a user to generate a playlist from a given search query?</li>
            <li class=.li-custom-a>A: More or less, using Spotify API and Genius API, in combination with some IR features!</li>
            <li class=.li-custom-q>Q: Can we generate a song lyric index for recent, popular songs?</li>
            <li class=.li-custom-a>A: Yes! By pulling songs from the Billboard Top 200 (Albums) via Spotify API, and their lyrics via Genius API, we can compile an index while also making use of tokenization and stemming.</li>
            <li class=.li-custom-q>Q: Can we search through the index using terms in the query?</li>
            <li class=.li-custom-a>A: Yes! We can perform a direct text match between the query terms and lyrics using TF-IDF to get the most relevant results.</li>
            <li class=.li-custom-q>Q: Can we perform sentiment analysis on the lyrics and query to better match the playlists ideal sentiment?</li>
            <li class=.li-custom-a>A: Yes, we have identified several libraries and lexicons to allow us to do this, in addition to Spotify's song (valence) features. This is a key future implementation!</li>
